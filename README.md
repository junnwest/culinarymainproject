# Food & Beverage Pairing Project (Work in Progress)

## **Project Status: In Progress**
This project is currently in progress. The primary goal is to build a data-driven model that suggests beverage pairings for various foods based on molecular composition and natural language processing techniques.

## **Current Progress**
**Data Sources Identified**:  
   - **FlavorDB**: Extracted food ingredient molecules and their flavor profiles.  
   - **CocktailDB API**: Fetching cocktail data for beverage pairing recommendations.  

**Data Loaded & Processed**:  
   - Successfully retrieved and structured food and beverage datasets.  
   - Cleaning and preprocessing of molecular flavor data and beverage descriptions in progress.  

## **Next Steps**
**Refine and Expand Datasets**: Improve the efficiency of data retrieval, filtering, and handling missing values.
**Feature Engineering**: Extract key molecular attributes and NLP-based insights for pairing analysis.
**Develop the Pairing Model**: Implement similarity algorithms to recommend food & beverage combinations.
